# Welcome to Overreacted Clone

This is a high-performance blog built with:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **React Server Components** for zero-JS pages
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **LAB color space** for smooth dark mode transitions
- **MDX** for enhanced markdown content

## Performance First

Every design decision prioritizes performance:

- Static generation at build time
- Minimal client-side JavaScript
- Optimized fonts with next/font
- AVIF and WebP image formats
- Edge caching strategy

## Zero-JS by Default

This page loads with zero client-side JavaScript. Everything you see is pre-rendered HTML and CSS.

## Beautiful Typography

Clean, readable typography inspired by overreacted.io, using system fonts with Inter as a fallback.
